**Implementations of common data structures**

## What?
This repository contains implementations of common data structures in Python. 

## Why?
I simply found it entertaining to create these implementations. I also wanted to get a feel for some nice data structures.

## How?
The implementations are not necesarily the most efficient possible but are instead made as illustrative as possible.

## Which?
The data structures currently implemented are

- Queue
- Stack

Data structures to implement can be found in TODO.txt
