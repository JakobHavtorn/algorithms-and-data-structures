**Implementations of common data structures**

## What?
This repository contains implementations of common data structures in Python. 

## Why?

## How?
The implementations are not necesarily the most efficient possible but made as illustrative as possible.

## Which?
The data structures currently implemented are

1. Stack
2. Queue
