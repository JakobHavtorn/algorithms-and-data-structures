**Implementations of common data structures**

## What?
This repository contains implementations of common data structures in Python. 

## Why?
I simply found it entertaining to create these implementations. I also wanted to get a feel for some nice data structures.

## How?
The implementations are not necesarily the most efficient possible but are instead made as illustrative as possible.

## Which?
The data structures currently implemented are

Queue
- enqueue
- dequeue
- peek
- is_full
- is_empty

Stack
- pop
- push
- peek
- is_full
- is_empty

Data structures to implement:
Graph
- add_vertex
- add_edge
- display_vertex
- depth_first_search (use stack)
- breadth_first_search (use queue)
- minimum_spanning_tree
- Kruskal’s algorithm
- Prims’s algorithm
- Dijkstras algorithm
- shortest_path

BinarySearchTree
- Special case of graph with zero, one or two child nodes of each node
- search
- insert
- find_min
- replace_node_in_parent
- traverse
- preorder
- inorder
- postorder

Maxheap
- Special case of binary search tree with max heap property.
- find_max
- extract_max
- delete_max
- insert
- replace
- heapify
- merge
- meld
- size
- is_empty
- increase_key
- delete
- sift_up
- heapsort

CircularBuffer
- https://embedjournal.com/implementing-circular-buffer-embedded-c/
- np.shift
- insert
- remove
- size
